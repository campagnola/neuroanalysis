    Two-sided confidence interval for a binomial test.
   
    Given n successes occurring out of p trials, what is the likely range of

    n : int
        The number of successful trials
    alpha : float
        The range of the confidence interval to return. (alpha=0.05 gives a 95% confidence interval)

    ----------
    x : float array
        X values of each observation. For cell-cell connectivity, this is the
