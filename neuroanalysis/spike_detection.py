    This function assumes that a square voltage pulse is used to evoke an unclamped spike
    in a voltage clamp recording, and that the peak of the unclamped spike occurs *during*
    the stimulation pulse.

    Parameters
    ==========
    trace : Trace instance
        The recorded patch clamp data. The recording should be made with a brief pulse intended
        to evoke a single spike with short latency.
    pulse_edges : (int, int)
        The start and end indices of the stimulation pulse. 
    sigma : float
        Time constant (sec) for a gaussian filter used to smooth the trace before 
        peak detection. default is 20 us.
    delay : float
        Time (sec) after the onset of the stimulation pulse to begin searching for the
        peak of the unclamped spike. This is used to exclude artifacts that can
        appear immediately after the pulse onset. Default is 150 us.
    threshold : float
        Threshold (amps) for detection of the unclamped spike peak (see Notes). Default
        is 50 pA.
        
    Notes
    =====
    
    This is a simple unclamped spike detection algorithm that compares the minimum
    pipette current value during the stimulation pulse to the final value before
    pulse offset. An unclamped spike is detected if the minimum value is less
    than the final value, and the difference is greater than the specified
    threshold. The rising phase of the action potential is determined by searching
    for a local minimum in the derivative of the pipette current immediately before
    the detected peak.    

    This algorithm generally performs well for spike detection, with few false
    positives or negatives. However, the max dv/dt measurement may be invalid for
    very small unclamped spikes, making the true latency of the spike difficult
    to measure.
